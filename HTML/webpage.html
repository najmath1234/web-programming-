<h2>about us</h2>
<p><center>In programming and software design, an event is an action or occurrence recognized by software, 
often originating asynchronously from the external environment, that may be handled by the software. 
Computer events can be generated or triggered by the system, by the user,An event handler is code that
is associated with a particular event, such as “button A pressed”. You create (or register) the association
between an event and an event handler by calling a function named “on “.or in other ways.</center></p>

configuration item, or monitoring tool. The sudden change of state
in a certain action or process can be identified as an “event”.</center></p>
